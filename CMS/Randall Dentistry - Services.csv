This prevents the need for more than just four implants to be used and all of the implants can be placed in one or two appointments.

We then administer this sedation and begin the surgery. Small incisions are made through the gums and the titanium implant posts are inserted deep into the bone. The sutures may be sutured to close the area and help promote proper healing. Over the course of about three to six months, your implants will naturally begin to fuse with the surrounding bone and become secure, stable and virtually permanent. You'll then come in and have a specially made denture for you after taking impressions. We'll show you how to remove and place the dentures as needed throughout the day.</p><p id="""">If you're interested in All-on-4 dental implants, <a href=""/contact"" id=""""> Call Us Today</a> and we will help to get you in for an appointment.</p>",Call Us Today!,"<p id="""">If you're interested in All on 4 Dental implants, <a href=""/contact"" id="""">Call Us Today</a> and we will help to get you in for an appointment.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4772c2a4754_62a31c8104a7b0c055845f68_AdobeStock_194285387.jpeg,"All on 4 Dental Implants in Dallas, TX - Randall Dentistry","Randall Dentistry specializes in General & Cosmetic Dentistry and offer All on 4 in Dallas, TX.

BioRejuvenation allows for minimally invasive treatments that rehabilitate the teeth and jaw for restored aesthetics and functionality. Whether you are young or old, have teeth that are severely worn down or unworn teeth that do not fit properly, BioRejuvenation dentistry will preserve the teeth you have and replace what is lost.

The first phase is critical in eliminating any and all bacterial infections from the teeth, gums, and bone. Then the jaw joints and the TMJs are restored to ideal health. This is achieved by wearing a custom-fit orthotic, adjusted until complete bite and joint stability is confirmed. After this TMJ therapy, models of the teeth and a recording of the bite will allow Dr. Randall to evaluate the extent of discrepancy in your bite. At this point, Dr. Randall may refer you to an orthodontist or an oral surgeon who will be able to create better alignment of your teeth. For the final treatment, a blueprint is made using a custom wax-up on the models to create the ideal biologic tooth form. This blueprint is transferred to the teeth through the use of impressions. This is completed over two days during two back-to-back appointments.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/63071212c7d1f1d0fb78915e_AdobeStock_490564534.jpg,BioRejuvenation Dentistry - Insurance Coverage,"<p id="""">The insurance coverage and cost of a BioRejuvenation dental procedure may vary from patient to patient.

Bone loss can often occur as a result of a variety of different conditions.

We then shape and file down the surrounding teeth. This will help to make room for the new fixed bridge. Impressions are then taken and will be used to create both a temporary and permanent bridge. You'll go home with the temporary one in place and will need to come back for a second appointment for the permanent. The temporary bridge is removed and the permanent one placed securely using a dental-grade adhesive.

If it's found that you do need a crown, it is best to have the work done right away to prevent further damage to the tooth. If you have an older crown that needs to be replaced, we can do this easily in our office at your own convenience. Crowns can be placed over virtually any tooth within the mouth in need of restoration.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d43f052a47e1_62a31c8104a7b0138b845f2b_AdobeStock_296898341.jpeg,What happens during the Dental Crown procedure?,"<p>The first step is to numb the area of the mouth that needs the crown. Dr. Randall will administer a local anesthetic to make the appointment more comfortable for you. The tooth is then filed down appropriately so that there is enough room for the restoration. We take impressions and use these to make the new crown. You will come in for a second appointment so that the final crown can be placed. You can expect the restoration to last for many years while providing you with a full and healthy-looking smile.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about how dental crowns are made and placed, <a href=""/contact""> call us today</a> to speak with one of our friendly staff members for further information.</p>",Call Us Today,"<p>If you'd like to learn more about how dental crowns are made and placed, <a href=""/contact"">Randall Dentistry</a> to speak with one of our friendly staff members for further information.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d44e2c2a4758_62a31c8104a7b03933845eb3_AdobeStock_296898485.jpeg,"Dental Crowns in Dallas, TX - Randall Dentistry","Randall Dentistry specializes in General & Cosmetic Dentistry and offer Dental Crowns in Dallas, TX.

Unlike other treatments, bonding typically doesn't require any type of anesthetic to complete. Bonding uses a material known as composite resin to carefully fill in gaps, spaces and chipped areas for a beautifully finished smile. Most bonding work can last for roughly a decade before it should be replaced with new material.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d448562a47e5_62a31c8104a7b0514d845f8a_AdobeStock_42747102.jpeg,,Why would you want or need Dental Bonding?,"<p>One of the key reasons for needing bonding work is because you either have gaps and spaces between your teeth or you've chipped a tooth. Bonding is done purely for cosmetic reasons, though it can be beneficial for patients whose teeth are sharp and jagged. Rather than live with an imperfect smile, composite resin can and should be used to improve the teeth. You'll love the way your smile looks after having bonding work done.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d404942a47e4_62a31c8104a7b0874b845f8b_AdobeStock_178410155.jpeg,,What makes a patient a candidate for Dental Bonding?,"<p>We will examine your teeth carefully before determining if bonding is right for you. Most of our patients who either want or need bonding can successfully have it placed. If the tooth is severely damaged or if you're experiencing pain, other treatments may be necessary. Older bonding material can be easily replaced by our team in the office.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d45ddb2a47e6_62a31c8104a7b01f8d845f94_AdobeStock_210084019.jpeg,What can you expect during Dental Bonding?,"<p>We start by slightly buffing and then filing down the tooth in need of bonding work. This helps the composite to stick onto the tooth better. We match the color of the resin before placing it on the tooth itself. From there, the resin is shaped and smoothed before being cured with a bright dental light. You can expect the new bonding material to last for roughly 10 years before it may begin to show signs of wear and damage. Bonding can be brushed and flossed around normally to keep the teeth healthy.</p><p>If dental bonding sounds like a solution to your smile problems, <a href=""/contact"">call us today</a> and our friendly staff members can get you scheduled with an appointment.</p>",Call Us Today,"<p>If dental bonding sounds like a solution to your smile problems, <a href=""/contact"">Trusmile Dentistry </a> and our friendly staff members can get you scheduled with an appointment.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d42c9e2a47e7_62a31c8104a7b0abef845f99_AdobeStock_316559273.jpeg,"Dental Bonding in Dallas, TX - Randall Dentistry","Randall Dentistry specializes in General & Cosmetic Dentistry and offer Dental Bonding in Dallas, TX.

In many cases, plaque will build up on different areas of the teeth, hardening into a chalky white substance known as tartar.

Dental decay, known as a cavity, can infiltrate a tooth and cause it to become weak. Over time, the decay essentially eats into the tooth to reach the inner pulp.

The decay is removed from the tooth completely. The next step is to prep the tooth for the new composite filling. We do this by applying an etching gel into the small hole, washing it away and then packing the hole with resin. The resin is cured and hardened with a special dental light.

Implants are a great choice for patients that have broken, damaged, or missing teeth. Implants act similar to an artificial tooth that is placed in the jawbone. They are extremely durable, and are built to last upwards of 25 years.</p><p>Dental implants function like our natural teeth, and allow patients to speak and eat normally.

We require a consultation with each patient to discuss any goals, and to determine the best treatment plan. Once we are ready to begin the implant process, the first step involves placing the implant into the jawbone. After this step is complete there is a healing process that must occur. </p><p>The healing period allows the implant time to fuse to the jawbone through a process called osseointegration. This allows the implant to function like a natural tooth root in the mouth. In order for the implant to remain sturdy, and provide the required support, the patient must have enough bone present in the jaw. If necessary, bone grafts can be done to provide the additional support that is needed.</p><p>Once the healing process is complete, the patient returns to our office to complete the implant process. An abutment or connector is placed on top of the implant, and this holds the crown securely in place. Custom crowns are made to match the shape, size, and color of your natural teeth. Temporary crowns may be necessary until patients return to have the permanent crown installed.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d45c5a2a47f1_62a31c8104a7b06da7845faa_dental-implants5.jpeg,,What are the Benefits of Dental Implants?,"<ul id=""""><li id="""">Preserve the natural bone in the mouth, and help to stimulate new bone growth.</li><li id="""">Implants are durable, and provide long term value financially compared to other restorative solutions.</li><li id="""">Dental implants are permanent, and do not slip or click like other solutions.</li><li id="""">Implants are comfortable, and look and feel natural in the mouth.</li><li id="""">Implants can last upwards of 25 years, or a lifetime if they are cared for properly.</li><li id="""">Dental Implants restore full chewing power, and are as strong as natural teeth.</li></ul><p id="""">If you are interested in finding out how you can benefit from Dental Implants, <a href=""/contact"">Randall Dentistry</a> to schedule your consultation.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d418422a47f5_62a31c8104a7b0815a845fa3_dental-implants9.jpeg,Call Us Today,"<p id="""">If you are interested in finding out how you can benefit from Dental Implants, <a href=""/contact"">Randall Dentistry</a> to schedule your consultation.</p>",,,,"Dental Implants in Dallas, TX - Randall Dentistry","Randall Dentistry specializes in General & Cosmetic Dentistry and offer Dental Implants in Dallas, TX.

Your overdenture is a great way to restore your smile and get away from the creams, gels and adhesive strips that you've been using for years.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4c6a62a4807_62a31c8104a7b0a1f2845f74_AdobeStock_263770995.jpeg,,Why would Implant-Supported Dentures be needed?,"<p>It's not uncommon to have an ill-fitting denture. Weight gain, weight loss and simply getting older can all have an impact on the way that your denture fits. If you're finding that you're constantly using strips and adhesive gels to keep your denture in place, it's time to look for a better alternative. implant-supported dentures are ideal because the implants themselves are permanent, so you won't need to worry about replacing them over time.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4381c2a4809_62a31c8104a7b057a1845f6c_AdobeStock_269972864.jpeg,,Who is a candidate for Implant-Supported Dentures?,"<p>To determine if you're a candidate for implant-supported dentures, we'll examine your mouth and take a look at your existing dentures. This will give us an idea of whether or not you'd benefit from implants. If you have bone loss, this could have an impact on how well the implants heal. For this, we recommend bone grafting prior to any implants being placed.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4bd452a4806_62a31c8104a7b06742845f72_AdobeStock_277311392.jpeg,What happens during the procedure to place Implant-Supported Dentures?,"<p>The first step is to provide you with sedation or anesthetic of your choosing. We will discuss these options during your consultation appointment. We then carefully make incisions through the gums and place the long, thin implant deep into the jawbone. The implants are then given time to heal. For most patients, this can take anywhere from three to six months depending on your own unique ability to heal. The next step is to make an overdenture for you using impressions. This denture is removable, but it will snap securely in place over the new implants.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about implant-supported dentures, <a href=""/contact"">call us today</a> to speak with one of our friendly staff members.</p>",Call Us Today,"<p>If you would like to learn more about implant-supported dentures, <a href=""/contact"">Trusmile Dentistry</a> to speak with one of our friendly staff members.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4ef772a480a_62a31c8104a7b010a6845f6e_AdobeStock_320684891.jpeg,"Implant Supported Dentures in Dallas, TX - Randall Dentistry","Randall Dentistry specializes in General & Cosmetic Dentistry and offer Implant Supported Dentures in Dallas, TX.

The restoration can be used to cover a tooth that has cracked or broken or to replace old fillings. They are typically made of porcelain, which allows them to look both natural and realistic. The benefit of both onlays and inlays is that they can last for many years without needing to be replaced.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62fb3f2f9c9bd92dcd7125ba_AdobeStock_517121530.jpg,,Why would Inlays and Onlays be needed?,"<p>There are a couple of reasons for why you might need to have either an inlay or an onlay placed. Your tooth might have cracked or broken across the very top of it. Rather than place a full dental crown, a smaller restoration will be perfect for the area. Likewise, we might recommend an onlay or inlay if you have a larger, older filling that needs to be completely replaced.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4e0b52a4817_62a31c8104a7b052d6845fa9_inlay-onlay1.jpeg,,Who is a candidate for Inlays and Onlays?,"<p>With an examination, we can determine if either of these restorations is best for you. The restoration is made for each individual patient, so it fits and feels completely comfortable. You can think of these restorations as smaller crowns, since they look and last as long as larger options. Inlays sit inside the grooves of a tooth while the onlay sits over the very top.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d47f012a4811_62a31c8104a7b00752845fa8_inlay-onlay2.jpeg,What happens during the procedure for Inlays and Onlays?,"<p>The process begins by removing decay, old filling material and smoothing out areas that are broken or cracked.

","<p>The reason you might want or need veneers is because the front of your smile is flawed. Your teeth might be cracked, stained, discolored, unevenly spaced or unsightly.

This procedure recreates the natural contour of the gums or jaw that was lost during the extraction. The bone that surrounds the roots of the teeth is called the alveolar ridge of the jaw. When a tooth is extracted, there is an empty socket left where the tooth originally was. This socket typically will heal on its own, and fill with tissue or bone. </p><p>If the socket breaks during tooth extraction this area will not be able to heal on its own. When this happens rebuilding the alveolar ridge may be necessary if the patient requires a dental implant. Dental implants require a sturdy base and bone structure for proper support. A ridge augmentation procedure helps to rebuild the area, and place the necessary support for the dental implant.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4f0a52a482e_623961efc198d62e9ab5ce79_ridge-augmentation-img2.jpeg,,When Are the Benefits of a Ridge Augmentation?,"<p>A Ridge augmentation procedure helps to recreate bone and tissue to support dental implants, and to make the gum and jaw area aesthetically pleasing. This procedure helps to provide long term function, and is typically done on patients that have decided to move forward with dental implants, dental bridges, or other tooth replacement options. Ridge augmentation can help to naturally contour the area so that your smile looks natural.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4ed752a482a_623961efc198d6986fb5ce78_ridge-augmentation-img3.jpeg,,How Does Ridge Augmentation Work?,"<p>A ridge augmentation procedure is done directly after the tooth is extracted. This procedure places bone grafting material in the tooth socket to rebuild the area, and provide the necessary support for tooth replacement. Doing this procedure directly after tooth extraction helps to avoid the need for a second procedure. </p><p>Once the area is built up, gum tissue is placed over the socket, and sutures are used to secure the area. A space maintaining product can be used over the area to help restore both the height and width of the space that was created after tooth extraction. The area must heal before the patient can return to prepare for their dental implant. Typically, local anesthesia is used to help keep patients comfortable during the procedure.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d460ff2a482d_623961efc198d68275b5ce7b_ridge-augmentation-img4.jpeg,What Can I Expect During the Recovery Process?,"<p>Depending on how severe the area was after tooth extraction, will determine how long your healing period will be. Typically, the healing period after a ridge augmentation procedure takes a few weeks. This gives the area time for the bone to grow and heal. After your procedure our doctors will discuss an after-care plan, and give you recommendations on how to care for your mouth at home during recovery.</p><p>We do recommend patients follow a soft food diet, and as the area heals, they can reintroduce harder foods back into their diet. Patients should avoid using straws or smoking as this can create pressure on the area, and impact the healing process. Patients should continue to practice good oral hygiene habits with brushing and flossing, and make sure to be gentle around the surgery area. Once the area is completely healed, we will require the patient to return to the office to discuss tooth replacement.</p><h3>Interested in Finding Out More About Ridge Augmentation?</h3><p>If you are interested in finding out more about ridge augmentation and how this procedure may benefit you, contact Randall Dentistry.

If a tooth has broken severely, it might have exposed the crack fully, causing a lot of sensitivity and pain. In order to eliminate this pain, we recommend that the pulp be removed as soon as possible.

We then work to remove the decay from the tooth and take out the pulp. The canals of the tooth are cleaned thoroughly and filled so that they do not become infected. Once this is done, we will recommend crowning the tooth to keep it fully protected.

Both children and adults can benefit from having sealants placed.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4a5cf2a4831_62a31c8104a7b048bf845f50_AdobeStock_245303462.jpeg,,What makes a person a candidate for Sealants?,"<p>With the help of a thorough examination, we will be able to determine if sealants are right for you.

We first clean and then dry the back teeth. A clear liquid varnish is then brushed over the teeth, only on the back chewing surfaces. These sealants are then dried and cured with a bright light.

The teeth whitening process helps to remove discoloration or stains from drinks, food, tobacco, or medications. Our whitening process is an accelerated whitening system that produces quick results, and does not damage the teeth or gums.</p><p>The whitening gel contains an active ingredient, and this breaks down during the whitening process to allow oxygen to reach the enamel of the teeth. As a result, the teeth become brighter and lighter in color. Professional teeth whitening can whiten teeth up to 10 shades lighter. Most patients see results instantly, or only after a few treatments. Having bright white teeth is important and builds confidence for patients of all ages. We want our patients to be proud of their smile, and our team is here to help our patients achieve the smile they have always wanted.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d470c82a483b_62a31c8104a7b0b419845f60_AdobeStock_184531142.jpeg,,What Options are Available for Teeth Whitening?,"<p>There are a few options that we offer to our patients for teeth whitening. For patients that prefer whitening their teeth in our office, we have a chairside whitening process. This treatment uses a light to activate whitening gel. This process removes stains from food and beverages, and patients can see results instantly. The chairside whitening process provides quick and effective results for patients seeking that bright white smile.</p><p>Another option we offer is an at home whitening kit. This option allows patients to whiten their teeth in the comfort of their own home. Custom trays are made in our office that are used alongside the whitening gel kit we send home. Patients place the whitening gel in their custom trays, and wear them for a specified amount of time. This method also produces amazing results, and patients can notice whiter teeth after just a few treatments.</p><p>After whitening patients may experience some sensitivity, but this should subside after a few days. If needed, patients can use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth to help alleviate any sensitivity after whitening. Overall the process is simple, and works quickly to give patients a beautiful white smile.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4fade2a483d_62a31c8104a7b0eae1845f61_AdobeStock_220974656.jpeg,Schedule Your Appointment,"<p id="""">To find out more about our teeth whitening options, and how we can help you achieve a bright white smile, <a href=""/contact"">Randall Dentistry</a> to schedule your appointment.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",,,,"Teeth Whitening in Dallas, TX - Randall Dentistry","Randall Dentistry specializes in General & Cosmetic Dentistry and offer Teeth Whitening in Dallas, TX.

","<p>The TMJ (temporomandibular joint) is the joint that connects your lower jaw to your skull. As with many other joints on the body, the TMJ can experience pain, discomfort, swelling and limited range of movement that gets in the way of your quality of life. When this occurs, it's known as TMD or temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

","<p>The TMJ is incredibly necessary when it comes to eating, chewing and simply opening and closing your mouth to speak. When the joint becomes inflamed or painful, you may find that it gets in the way of living your best life. Some problems to look for concerning the TMJ include:</p><ul><li>Clicking, popping or grinding of the jaw bone</li><li>Inability to open your mouth fully without pain or discomfort</li><li>Inflammation and tenderness</li><li>Earaches that are otherwise unexplained</li><li>Difficulty chewing and biting into your favorite foods</li><li>Locking of the jaw</li></ul>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d402fd2a4859_AdobeStock_301010345.jpg,,"What makes you a good candidate for TMJ Treatments?

","<p id="""">In some cases, TMJ problems resolve on their own and are simply temporary. If the pain, discomfort and swelling persists, we'll often recommend physical therapy, muscle relaxants, pain relievers and hot/cold therapy as a way to help ease your suffering. In more extreme cases, surgery is required to help improve motion of the jaw and prevent swelling. The most common procedure performed is known as temporomandibular arthrocentesis, which simply means that the fluid is removed from the joint before the bone is realigned. Surgery-free options are always sought after first before considering more invasive procedures</p><p id="""">If you think you might benefit from TMJ treatments, <a href=""/contact"" id="""">call our office today</a> &nbsp;and we can get you in for an appointment.</p>",,,,"TMJ Therapy in Dallas, TX - Randall Dentistry","Randall Dentistry specializes in General & Cosmetic Dentistry and offer TMJ Therapy in Dallas, TX.

In some cases, you may need to have teeth removed because of advanced gum disease. In other cases, you'll need an extraction because you have an impacted wisdom tooth.

Some teeth are simply an issue to your oral health, so it's best to remove them before they're allowed to cause issues with shifting, infection and intra-oral damage. Some of the reasons you may want or need an extraction include:</p><ul><li>Impacted wisdom teeth</li><li>Loose or severely decayed teeth</li><li>Teeth that are cracked or broken below the gum line</li><li>Stubborn baby teeth</li><li>You're looking to avoid having additional treatment done</li></ul>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d478aa2a4841_62a31c8104a7b02120845fd1_AdobeStock_335474953.jpeg,,Who is a candidate for Tooth Extractions?,"<p>With the help of an examination, we can determine if you might need an extraction. Most patients who need an extraction can and should have the procedure done. Leaving a problem tooth intact can cause issues down the road with infections and abscesses. We will take x-rays to help in further identifying the need for an extraction.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62b19344d3d1d4033a2a46ab/62b19344d3d1d4c6422a4842_62a31c8104a7b06cd8845fcf_AdobeStock_47333061.jpeg,What happens during a Tooth Extraction?,"<p>We first provide you with anesthetic or sedation of your choosing. We can discuss our sedation options with you during your consultation. Once you're comfortable, we will loosen and remove the tooth. We may place sutures if they are needed to close the gums. We have you bite down on gauze to stop the bleeding. If you've been sedated, we will bring you to a recovery room to fully wake up. You should be brought home by a friend or relative if general sedation has been used.
