An analysis of your bite is done to determine if you have a poor bite or a dental malocclusion. To complete a bite evaluation, highly qualified dentist Dr. Drew Randall utilizes innovative technologies at his practice in Dallas, TX to check the potency of your teeth and also ascertain how much pressure is exerted by every tooth. A bite analysis could identify when you have an overbite, underbite, or crossbite. We also assess your muscles, jaw, and teeth as a whole to try to find any underlying difficulties, which might be brought on by a poor bite. If not handled correctly, a poor bite may result in future issues, which could be debilitating or painful so it is crucial to get a diagnosis once you observe a painful or uncomfortable bite. To get a bite analysis, contact Randall Dentistry.</p><h2 id="""">BITE ANALYSIS – BEST CANDIDATES</h2><p id="""">You may have many reasons to receive a bite diagnosis and decide whether a disorder is present. Several of the most typical symptoms include crooked, cracked, chipped, or broken teeth, pain while chewing, chronic jaw aches or headaches, inflamed or rigid jaw, along with receding gums. Sometimes, a misaligned bite may result in teeth grinding, also called bruxism, which may cause additional pain along with a reduction of dental enamel.</p><h2 id="""">BITE ANALYSIS – WHAT TO EXPECT</h2><p id="""">Your bite analysis usually is made up of electronic imaging, a 3D oral scan, a bite study, along with a physical evaluation from <a href=""/about#dr-randall"">Dr. Randall</a>. Once the problems with your bite are recognized, there are a number of treatment methods based on the intensity of your circumstance. In more moderate instances, a nighttime <a href=""/services/mouthguards"" id="""">dental guard</a> is generally advocated, though some serious problems may need operative therapy.</p><h2 id="""">BITE ANALYSIS – FOLLOW-UP</h2><p id="""">It is essential that if you experience any additional problems with your alignment, you should continue to schedule regular dental exams to ensure that Dr. Randall evaluates any modifications, even after therapy. It is also wise to continue to maintain a proper home dental hygiene regimen, including regular flossing, brushing, and mouthwash.</p><h2 id="""">BITE ANALYSIS – INSURANCE COVERAGE</h2><p id="""">Before your bite analysis, our financial staff will get in touch with your insurance provider to ascertain your insurance coverage and if there will be any additional out-of-pocket expenses. Randall Dentistry accepts many payment options and we will be able to help you find low-interest medical financing so that your therapy is affordable.</p><h2 id="""">BITE ANALYSIS</h2><p id="""">When you are having any abnormalities with your bite or feel pain when you eat or speak, you might want to receive a bite evaluation. Dr. Randall can diagnose what could be causing the issue and assist in taking care of it before additional problems occur. Employing state-of-the-art technologies, Randall Dentistry will collect all of the information required to provide you with an analysis and a customized treatment plan to renew your bite and overall dental wellness.</p>","If your teeth do not fit together properly, it may be damaging to your gums and teeth, and can also result in discomfort in your jaw.

Keeping your teeth healthy with braces is extremely important. This includes brushing and flossing each day to keep that sticky plaque from building up between brackets and wires.

Whether you're looking to boost your confidence or are going to be attending a wedding, reunion or another big event, a bright and white smile is sure to improve your appearance. Expert whitening is performed in our office or provided to you using a professional-grade take-home kit. Whitening results can last for months to one or more years, and maintaining your results is key to ensuring that you'll always have a gorgeous smile.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why Should I Whiten My Teeth?</strong></p><p id="""">There are many factors that come into play when it comes to the whiteness and brightness of your smile. If you're a smoker, drink a lot of coffee, tea or cola or you're taking certain medications, you'll notice that your teeth aren't as white as they used to be. Likewise, just the act of aging can have a serious impact on the way that your smile looks. By professionally whitening your teeth, you can expect dramatic results that help to increase your self-esteem and confidence.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How Often Should Teeth Whitening Be Done?</strong></p><p id="""">It is best to avoid whitening your teeth too often. Over-whitening your teeth can lead to issues with hypersensitivity or even cause the teeth to look translucent. It is often recommended that you only whiten your teeth, whether at home or professionally, once a year. This prevents issues involving sensitivity and helps in creating a natural-looking smile. The benefit of utilizing professional whitening is that results typically last for about one year. This simply means that you won't feel the need to touch-up or go with another whitening system because of how drastic the change is when using a professional whitening option.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How Can I Maintain My Results?</strong><br>The best way to prevent the need for touch-ups is to avoid future staining and discoloration of the teeth. If you're a smoker, now is the best time to quit and a great way to extend the length of your results. Try to avoid drinking too many dark liquids, like coffee and cola, and opt for water instead. You may want to consider using a whitening toothpaste so help clear away stains and discoloration before they are able to get worse. Be sure to speak with the experts about whitening and always discuss when the last time you whitened your teeth actually was before retreatment.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Looking for a Cosmetic Dentist?</strong><br>If you are looking for a friendly dentist, <a href=""/contact"">contact us</a> for your next teeth whitening!

Is It Better to Get a Dental Implant or a Bridge?,is-it-better-to-get-a-dental-implant-or-a-bridge,62b19344d3d1d47ba62a46ae,637def2eca19c0af205e8bdc,Wed Nov 23 2022 10:00:14 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Nov 23 2022 10:00:33 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Nov 23 2022 10:00:43 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,"<p id="""">When deciding on a restorative solution it is important to look at all of your options to help you decide on the best option that works for you. A common question patients face is if they should choose a dental bridge or dental implants when they are looking for a tooth replacement solution. Both are restorative solutions for missing teeth, and it is helpful to understand the differences. At our practice, we provide our patients with a thorough consultation to examine their teeth and mouth, and discuss the differences between all of the restorative options available. Our staff works closely with our patients to help choose the best solution.&nbsp;</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What Is a Dental Bridge?</strong></p><p id="""">A dental bridge is a fixed restoration that fills the gap created by one or more missing teeth. Bridges are anchored to one or more neighboring teeth also known as abutment teeth. Bridges can be supported by natural teeth or by dental implants. The false teeth are in-between and are called pontics.&nbsp;</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How Do Dental Bridges Work?</strong></p><p id="""">During your first appointment we prepare the neighboring teeth. The preparation for a bridge involves removing part of the enamel to allow room for the crown. The crowns are placed over the neighboring teeth. Impressions of your teeth are taken to make the bridge in the lab, and temporary bridges are used while you wait for your permanent bridge.</p><p id="""">Patients return to the office, and we remove the temporary bridge to prepare for the permanent bridge. The new bridge is installed, and we check to make sure the bridge is comfortable, and the perfect fit. Patients may have to return to our office again to ensure the bridge is working well with your bite. Once we know the bridge fits properly we will cement the bridge in place.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How Long Will Dental Bridges Last?</strong></p><p id="""">Dental bridges last around 10-15 years. Bridges do involve using some of your natural teeth, and this can cause your bridge to fail over time. The teeth around the bridge are still vulnerable to decay and disease which can attribute to the life of the bridge. Patients must practice good oral hygiene habits at home to keep the bridge and surrounding teeth clean. We recommend brushing twice a day and flossing to ensure you carefully clean around both the false and natural teeth. Visiting our office regularly can help to keep your teeth clean, and your bridge looking and feeling great.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Benefits of Dental Bridges</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Surgery is not required</li><li>Dental bridges tend to be less costly compared to implants</li><li>Jawbone density is not an issue with bridges&nbsp;</li><li>Overall the bridge procedure is less invasive compared to dental implants</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Dental Implants</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What Are Dental Implants?</strong></p><p id="""">Implants are a permanent solution for patients that have missing, broken, or damaged teeth. They are durable, and act similar to a screw that is placed into the jawbone. The screw acts like an artificial tooth root, and provides a strong base for one or more artificial teeth. Implants require a healing period to give the implant time to fuse to the jawbone. This process allows the implant to function just like a natural tooth.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How Do Dental Implants Work?</strong></p><p id="""">Dental implants require multiple appointments in our office, and the process takes a few months. The first step involves placing the implant into the patient’s jawbone. Once this is done there is a healing period where we must give the implant time to fuse to the jawbone. This process is known as osseointegration.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Part of our implant evaluation process is to determine if the patient has adequate bone in the jaw to support the implants. If needed, bone grafting can be done to give patients the bone required to provide the necessary support. Once the healing process is complete the patient returns to our office, and an abutment or connector is placed on top of the implants. This allows the crown to be secured to the implant. Custom crowns are made to match the size, shape, and color of your natural teeth. Temporary crowns may be used while patients wait for the permanent crowns to be installed.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How Long Will Dental Implants Last?</strong></p><p id="""">Dental implants are durable and last upwards of 25 years, or a lifetime if they are cared for properly. Implants are built out of titanium, and provide patients with a permanent solution for missing teeth. Caring for dental implants is similar to caring for natural teeth, and we recommend practicing good oral hygiene habits at home to keep your implants looking and feeling great.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Benefits of Dental Implants</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Dental implants are long lasting, and are a permanent restorative solution</li><li>Easy to care for</li><li>Implants function like natural teeth</li><li>Chewing power is restored with dental implants</li><li>Speech and overall appearance are improved</li><li>Patients can eat all the foods they normally would with implants</li><li>Dental Implants tend to cost more, but are a good investment because they are built to last</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Looking For a Dentist to Provide Dental Implants or Dental Bridges?</strong></p><p id="""">Choosing the best restorative option is a big decision, and our team is here to help.

Crowns help keep the underlying tooth from breaking apart, and can be used to help fix an area on a tooth that is broken. There are different types of crowns available to patients, and depending on the severity of the tooth will determine which type of crown is best. Crowns are typically made of hard materials such as porcelain or ceramic, but can also be made of gold, resin, or stainless steel. They can be made to match the color, size, and shape of your natural teeth and blend in nicely. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pros of Dental Crowns</strong></p><p id="""">Dental crowns improve your appearance, and can help correct any cosmetic issues in the mouth.

In some cases, crowns may need to be repaired or replaced. This is not common but does happen occasionally. During a crown procedure the tooth has to be filed down to ensure the crown can be securely placed. If a crown is not fitted properly there is risk that it can fall out, or allow bacteria to enter underneath the crown. Patients may become more sensitive to hot or cold after their crown is placed. Our office typically recommends a sensitive toothpaste to help with this issue.</p><p id="""">If patients ever have an issue with a crown we encourage them to contact our office right away. Leaving a damaged crown untreated can lead to further issues or complications. Overall, crowns are extremely helpful in preserving teeth, and give patients a beautiful natural white smile.

If you notice your <strong id="""">teeth turning black</strong>, it can be scary. However, you can consult your dentist who can recommend an appropriate treatment depending on why the teeth have turned black.</p><h2 id="""">Reasons for Teeth Turning Black</h2><p id="""">There are two types of causes for black teeth: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic causes of teeth turning black include external influences that affect the teeth. Enamel damage, tooth discolouration, or tartar build-up are all possibilities. It could also be caused by certain foods, beverages, medications, tobacco usage, toothpaste, rinses, and silver fillings. Intrinsic causes of teeth turning black, on the other hand, are caused by internal dental issues. Cavities, decay, infected pulp, and a tooth that has died are such examples.</p><p id="""">Here are some of the reasons for teeth turning black that you may be experiencing:</p><h2 id="""">Tobacco</h2><p id="""">We all know that tobacco products and smoking is injurious to health. In addition to being one of the reasons for teeth turning black, it can also cause other dental health problems.</p><p id="""">If you smoke a lot, it is highly recommended to start your journey toward quitting this harmful habit.</p><h2 id="""">Trauma</h2><p id="""">Trauma to the teeth can end up damaging the enamel. The secondary dentin, which is the layer beneath the enamel, can start to build up following the damage from the trauma.</p><p id="""">This build-up can become dark in colour as well as cause the tooth pulp, which is the living tissue of the tooth, to shrink.</p><h2 id="""">Silver Fillings</h2><p id="""">Dental fillings are a popular cosmetic treatment.
